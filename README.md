Notes for munki setup
The Notes and scripts contained in this folder are based on the munki setup I am currently using. I'm new to scripting so setting up munki was a bit of a challenge, however having found documentation on github i managed to get my setup working. 

How does this document differ from whats out there?
> I've written this based on no assumptions about the end user. Those who consider using the notes need not have scripted before. It's also designed to guide the user from start to finish with their setup process for multiple aspects associated with Munki. My notes give the user the basic understanding of what needs to be done and how the end result would be achieved. The user can then run scripts associated with a given section, and should they waht to go into more depth they can refer to the links within.
