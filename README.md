Munki Docs
=========

Why have yet another document describing a _munki_ setup? 
> I came across _munki_ over a year ago and as a _fresh_ Mac Admin thought it would be great to do a trial run. Once i got my setup working, I looked around for other bits that would complement my setup and thats whats described here. 
> This documentation will guide you set-by-step in establishing a standard setup which utilises _munki_, _munkiwebadmin_, _munkireport-php_ and _munki-enroll_. It also describes how I use _autopkg_ and _munkiadmin_ as part of my current setup. 

Who is this documentation for? 
> If you're just starting out with _munki_ and associated tools, this could be the documentation for you. 

How does the documentation work?
> The setup process is divided into series of steps. Each step provides a basic overview of what needs to be done and how the end result would be achieved. You can then either run scripts associated with a given section, or write them yourself based on your setup. 
> For proficient users the documentation might appear to be quite basic in its structure, however this was written when I was
just starting out as a Mac admin. The documentation here is based on my _initial_ setup experience and illustrates a quick way to get services up and running for a beginner.

Does this replace other documentation out there?
> NO (and I can't stress this enough). This documentation will only assist you with a basic setup focused around _munki_ and associated tools that I use in my environment. 
> There is a large community of users with unique setups and environments who rely on tools mentioned within this document. To get a better understanding of how these tools work, I recommend you spend time reading the original text(s) and wiki's or join the community groups. 

I've gone through the steps but it still doesnt work?
