Notes for munki setup
> The Notes and scripts contained in this folder are based on the munki setup I am currently using. I'm new to scripting so getting everything working was a bit of a challenge, however having found documentation on github i managed to get my setup working. 

How does this document differ from whats already out there?
> The steps listed in the Seup folder, assume that like me the ned user has little/no knowledge of scripting. The steps are designed to guide the end user from from start to finish with their setup process for multiple aspects associated with Munki. 
> The steps provide a basic overview of what needs to be done and how the end result would be achieved. The user can then run scripts associated with a given section, and should they waht to go into more depth they can refer to the links within the document.
