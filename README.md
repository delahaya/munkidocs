Notes for munki setup
> The Notes and scripts contained in this folder are based on the munki setup I am currently using. 

Whats the need for another document describing Munki?
> I'm new to scripting and have just started managing mac's at my work environment. I came across munki, and thought it would be great to do a trial run. Once i got my setup working, I looked around for other bits that would complement my setup and thats whats described here.
> In short, the documentation here describes my setup and gives easy access to external documentation I found useful. The steps listed in the Seup folder, assume that like me the ned user has little/no knowledge of scripting. The steps are designed to guide the end user from from start to finish with their setup process for multiple aspects associated with Munki. 

Who should consider using this documentation?
> If you've never really worked with scripts before, don't have much experience using the Terminal, or just cant be asked to look for multiple sources of information - this might be the documentation for you.

How does the documentation work?
> The setup process is dividied into series of steps. Each step provides a basic overview of what needs to be done and how the end result would be achieved. The user can then run scripts associated with a given section, and should they waht to go into more depth they can refer to the links within the document.

Does this replace other documentation out there?
> NO (and i can't stress this enough). This documentation will only aid you with your initial setup. To get a better understanding of how Munki and associated tools mentioned work, I recommend you spend time reading the origional text. Links to resources are provided in each setp.
