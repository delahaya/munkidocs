For out setup we're using a Mac Mini with running OSX 10.10.5. The OSX install and configration for our machine is based on a DeployStudi workflow and puppet manifest.

# Setting up the Server App.
  # Our setup uses v 3.2.2. At the time of writing this version is no longer available from the app store. We hold a local copy of the App on an internal package share.
  1. Access the Server App package from the package share 
	2. Mount the package on your server machine
	3. Move Server App to /Applications
	4. Launch Server App
		a. Click on Websites on bottom left column
		b. Enable web sharing by clicking 'ON' button
		c. Enable php
	5. Quit Server App

# Now that the server app has been setup, i found it was best to run the setup process under a newly created admin user called 'munki'. This is not necessary, hoewver, if you do chose to do this it could be done in 1 of 2 ways.
  # Method 1: Create a new user manually by going to 'System Preferences'
  
  # Method 2: Create a new user by deploying a user package as part of your OS deployment process. 
  > To achieve this I used 'CreateUserPkg' which can be downloaded from : http://magervalp.github.com/CreateUserPkg/
  > Overview and security notes about 'CreateUserPkg' can be found here:  https://github.com/MagerValp/CreateUserPkg
    # Note: If you do use 'CreateUserPkg', ensure that the UID for your account does not conflict with other UID's
