# This section is only applicable to our current work environment. 
# For the purpose of this setup we are using a clean machine with fresh OS install. The machine is puppet managed. 

# Basic Machine Setup
	1. Create a NetReg entry for your chosen server machine.
	2. Within Netreg, set the following parameters
 		a. install parameters:role=darwin_workstation; 
		b. user:<admin username>		
	3. Once the entry is created, connect the machine to the network.	
	4. Power the machine and press the 'alt' key
	5. From the drives listed choose 'puppet' 

# If 'puppet' is not listed hold down the 'N' key for network drive scan
	6. Once booted from puppet, you will see a deploy studio screen
	7. Enter Admin credentials and log in
	8. Choose the 'New Desktop' workflow
	9. Leave machine powered on to let deployment finish
	
# Setting up the Server App.
  # Our setup uses v 3.2.2. At the time of writing this version is no longer available from the app store. We hold a local copy of the App on an internal package share.
  1. Access the Server App package from the package share 
	2. Mount the package on your server machine
	3. Move Server App to /Applications
	4. Launch Server App
		a. Click on Websites on bottom left column
		b. Enable web sharing by clicking 'ON' button
		c. Enable php
	5. Quit Server App

# Now that the server app has been setup, i found it was best to run the setup process under a newly created admin user called 'munki'. This is not necessary, hoewver, if you do chose to do this it could be done in 1 of 2 ways.
  # Method 1: Create a new user manually by going to 'System Preferences'
  
  # Method 2: Create a new user by deploying a user package as part of your OS deployment process. 
  > To achieve this I used 'CreateUserPkg' which can be downloaded from : http://magervalp.github.com/CreateUserPkg/
  > Overview and security notes about 'CreateUserPkg' can be found here:  https://github.com/MagerValp/CreateUserPkg
    # Note: If you do use 'CreateUserPkg', ensure that the UID for your account does not conflict with other UID's
