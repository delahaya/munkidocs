# --- Basic Machine Setup --- #

# This setup uses a Mac Mini running OS X 10.10.5 as our server machine and
# utilizes the Apple Server App as part of the installation. OS X installation
# and configuration is achieved using a combination of DeployStudio & Puppet

# Setting up the Server App on your machine.
  1. Download the Server App form the Mac App Store.
	4. Launch Server App
		a. Click on Websites in the bottom left column
		b. Enable web sharing by clicking 'ON' button
		c. Enable php
	5. Quit Server App

# Your Server App has now been setup. For the remainder of the installation, I
# chose to create a new admin user called _munki_. This step is not mandatory,
# however should you choose to do this you can go about it in one of two ways.

Method 1: Create a new user manually via 'System Preferences'
Method 2: Create a new user by deploying a user package within your OS deployment process.

# I used 'CreateUserPkg' <http://magervalp.github.com/CreateUserPkg/> and attached
# the user package to our OS deployment process.
