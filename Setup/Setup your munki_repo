# The following process will help you setup your 'munki_repo' and link it to your server. 
# The repo contains 4 primary sub-directories that include the catalogs, manifests,
# packages and associated package information. Along with this, as you progress in the setup
# process you'll find that icons, client resources and enroll settings are also housed with the repo.

# Creating the munki_repo directory

# To create the directory manually:
  1. Launch Terminal
  2. Navigate to your desired volume: cd /Volumes/<your-volume>
  # Create a directory called 'Munki' and then a sub-directory called 'munki_repo'
    1. mkdir Munki
    2. mkdir Munki/munki_repo

    # Create the 4 primary sub-directories within munki_repo
    a. mkdir Munki/munki_repo/catalogs
    b. mkdir Munki/munki_repo/manifests
    c. mkdir Munki/munki_repo/pkgs
    d. mkdir Munki/munki_repo/pkgsinfo

    # Modify permissions associated with 'munki_repo'
    i. chmod -R a+rX /<your-volume>/Munki/munki_repo

# Your 'munki_repo' directory has now been setup.

# Now that your 'munki_repo' directory has been setup, you need to create a symbolic link
# between your web server's default location and your repo location.
# By default the web server location is: /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default

# Launch Terminal and become _root_
a. sudo ln -s /<your-volume>/Munki/munki_repo /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/Default

# Your symbolic link has now been created. You can verify this either by navigating
# to the folder or via the server app.
