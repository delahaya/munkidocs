# The following steps will help you setup Munki Admin to work with your munki_repo. At the time of writing, the latest version of Munki Tools was v 2.0.1

# Setup Munki Admin
  1. Open Safari and download MunkiTools (available here: https://github.com/munki/munki/releases/tag/v2.0.10)
  2. Navigate to your 'Downloads' folder and run the .pkg file
  
    # Gate Keeper may prevent you from running the file unless it is turned off in system preferences. If so, open system preferences then click on 'Security & Privacy' and under the 'General' tab click on 'open anyway'
    
    # Continue with the installation until you get the 'Customize' option. Under the 'Customize' option
      1. Ensure Munki Core tools is checked
      2. Ensure Munki Admin tools is checked
      3. Deselect Managed software updates (only required for client machines)
      4. Deselect LaunchD agents           (only required for client machines)
      5. Click Install.
    
    # Once Munki tools is installed, you need to configure munkiimport settings. This will inform Munki of your repo path, the prefered pkginfo extension, prefered pkginfo editor and the name of your default catalog. As with the folder setup you could do this in 1 of 2 ways. 
    
      # Configuring munkiimport using a script
        1. Download the 'configure-munki' script from the Scripts folder
        2. Open the script using your prefered text editor and change the following based on your preference:
          Line 6: change 'editor' from TextWrangler to your prefered app
          Line 9: change repo_path to /<your-chosen-volume>/Munki/munki_repo
          Line 11: change pkginfo_extension from '.plist' to one you prefer
          Line 15: change default_catalog from 'testing' to a name you prefer
        3. Save the script 
        4. Launch Terminal and navigate to script location, then run the following:
          a: ./configure-munki.sh
        # You have now configured your munkiimport settings
        
        # Configuring munkiimport using Terminal
        1. Launch Terminal
        2. cd /usr/local/munki/munkiimport
          # Edit options as required or hit return to use default options.
        
      # Verifying munkiimport setting
      # If you used the script and want to confirm that the settings work, follow step 1 & 2 of the 'Configuring munkiimport using Terminal' section. The settings you specified in the script will now appear as the default settings. You could either change them at this point (if required) or hit return at each option to stay with current settings.
