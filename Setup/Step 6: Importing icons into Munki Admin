# If you primarily use the AutoPkgr app to update your repo, or decide to import software using the Munki Admin GUI, you'll
# notice that your software has no associated icons. You can extract icons from your packages by doing the following.

  # Using the iconimport script
    1. Download the 'iconimport' script from the Scripts folder
    2. Launch Terminal as Root
    3. Run the 'iconimport' script
    
    # What does the script do?
      > The script pulls the 'iconimport' file from github and saves it as 'iconimport.py' in your /usr/local/munki folder
      > It then proceeds to correct permissions associated with the file. In the next step it executes the python script,
      > and places the icons associated with your packages in an 'Icons' folder, located in your 'munki_repo' directory.
      
    # What to do once the script has run?
      1. Open Munki Admin
      2. Click reload.
      # At this point extracted icons will be associated with your software. 
      
    # Icon import extracted icons for my software, but they dont appear on refresh.
      > This is potentially because there is more than one icon associated with your software. In this case you would need
      > to manually choose which icon you would like to use. You can do this by going through the following steps.
        1. Launch Munki Admin
        2. Select a package
		    3. Right click and navigate to 'Icons'
		    4. Choose existing icon for package '<your-chosen-package>'
		    5. From the pop-up window select an icon and click okay
		    
		# Importing icons in the future. 
		# As you have already stored the 'iconimport.py' file in the correct location, icon imports for future software can 
		# be done by launching Terminal and running the following commands.
		  1. cd /usr/local/munki
		  2. ./iconimport.py /<your-munki_repo-folder-location>
		    # E.g: ./iconimport.py /Volumes/LocalDataHD/Munki/munki_repo
