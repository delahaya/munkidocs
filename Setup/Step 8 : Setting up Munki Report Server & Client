# A bit like MunkiWebAdmin, Munki Report gives you an overview of your client machines and the software deployed to them. 
# It also displays information from the System Profiler on your client machine, providing the administrator with a snapshot
# of the state of the machine. 

# Note: For my setup, I'm deploying the munki report client package as a forced install on all clients.
