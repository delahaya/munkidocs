# Munki Enroll, enables you to enroll clients as they check in with the server for the first time. It also gives you the 
# flexibility to to deploy common applications to all clients whilst being able to customize applications for specific clients. 

# Origional documentation for Munki Enroll can be found here: https://github.com/edingc/munki-enroll

  # How my current setup works
    # To get munki-enroll going i've used the documentation available at the site listed above. My setup is no different from 
    # what's listed on the site, however I did have 1 issue the first time I set it up which has since been resolved. Only the 
    # issue and solution are documented below. 
    
  # Issue I faced with munki-enroll
    # munki-enroll works extremely well straight out of the box. It looks at the host name of the client machine and then 
    # checks if a manifest for the client exists. If not, it creates a new manifest based on the host name and puts in a
    # folder called 'clients'. 
    # The path to your client manifests with munki-enroll would be: /<your-munki_repo-directory-location>/manifests/clients
    
    # When a new manifest was created for my client machines, I would look at Munki Admin and find that there appeared to be 
    # a blank manifest under the 'included manifests' tab. This would give errors when checking managed software update, 
    # as the clients were effectively searching for a ghost manifest. 
      # If you delete this blank manifest, things work as planned but this is not the solution. 
      
    # Having discussed the issue with Cody (see his github link above), he mentioned that munki-enroll was set up such that
    # client machines included a manifest that would provide common packages to all registered machines, leaving the manin
    # client manifest free for customization based on user needs. 
    
  # Including your nested manifest for munki-enroll
    # I have a manifest called 'common_packages' that resides in /munki_repo/manifests
    # This manifest contains common applications that I would deploy on all client machines as standard. To add this as a
    # 'included manifest' as part of my munki-enroll setup, i did the following.
      
      1. On your server, navigate to /munki_repo/munki-enroll
      2. Open 'enroll.php' using your favourite editor
      3. On line 44 (under 'Add Parent Manifest' comment): change '$identifier' to '<your-common-applications-manifest-name>' 
      
  # This has been working well for me and my client machines respond as expected.
