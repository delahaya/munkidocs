# The following process will help you setup your 'munki_repo' drirectory. The repo contains 4 primary sub-directories that include the catalogs, manifests, packages and associated package information. Along with this, as you progress in the setup process you'll find that icons, client resources and enroll settings are also housed with the repo. 

Note : Our setup has a volume called 'LocalDataHD' and thats where I shall be hosting 'munki_repo'. If you do use the notes below, please make sure you substitute your Volume name in place of 'LocalDataHD'

# Creating the munki_repo directory
# You can create the directory and associated sub-directories in 1 of 2 ways. Either use the terminal and follow the instructions below, or run the 'munki-folder-setup' script from the scripts folder. 

# If you plan to use the script:
  1. Download the script
  2. Modify the 'Volume' location (see note above) using your prefered text editor
  3. Save the file
  4. Launch Terminal 
    # Run the script: 
    a: Navigate to script location
    b: ./munki-folder-setup.sh  
# Your 'munki_repo' directory has now been setup.   
  
# To create the directory manually:
  # Navigate to your chosen Volume
  1. Launch Terminal 
  2. cd /Volumes/LocalDataHD
    # Create a directory called 'Munki' and then a sub-directory called 'munki_repo'
    1. mkdir Munki
    2. mkdir Munki/munki_repo
    
    # Create the 4 primary sub-directories within munki_repo
    a. mkdir Munki/munki_repo/catalogs
    b. mkdir Munki/munki_repo/manifests
    c. mkdir Munki/munki_repo/pkgs
    d. mkdir Munki/munki_repo/pkgsinfo
    
    # Modify permissions associated with 'munki_repo'
    i. chmod -R a+rX /<your-chosen-volume>/Munki/munki_repo
    
# Your 'munki_repo' directory has now been setup.
