  "body": "**# munki Docs**\r\n=========\r\n\r\n## **Why have yet another document describing a _munki_ setup?**\r\n> I came across _munki_ over a year ago and as a _fresh_ Mac Admin thought it would be great to do a trial run. Once i got my setup working, I looked around for other bits that would complement my setup and thats whats described here.\r\nThis documentation will guide you set-by-step in establishing a standard setup which utilises _munki_, _munkiwebadmin_, _munkireport-php_ and _munki-enroll_. It also describes how I use _autopkg_ and _munkiadmin_ as part of my current setup.\r\n\r\n## **Who is this documentation for?**\r\n> If you're just starting out with _munki_ and associated tools, this could be the documentation for you.\r\n\r\n## **How does the documentation work?**\r\n> The setup process is divided into series of steps. Each step provides a basic overview of what needs to be done and how the end result would be achieved. You can then either run scripts associated with a given section, or write them yourself based on your setup.\r\nFor proficient users the documentation might appear to be quite basic in its structure, however this was written when I was just starting out as a Mac admin. The documentation here is based on my _initial_ setup experience and illustrates a quick way to get services up and running for a beginner.\r\n\r\n## **Does this replace other documentation out there?**\r\n> _**NO**_ (and I can't stress this enough). This documentation will only assist you with a basic setup focused around _munki_ and associated tools that I use in my environment.\r\nThere is a large community of users with unique setups and environments who rely on tools mentioned within this document. To get a better understanding of how these tools work, I recommend you spend time reading the original text(s) and wiki's or join the community groups.\r\n\r\n## **I've gone through the steps but it still doesn't work?**\r\n> You might want to consider making use of the documentation below.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n  * [munki](https://github.com/munki/munki/wiki)\r\n  * [munkiadmin](https://github.com/hjuutilainen/munkiadmin)\r\n  * [munkiwebadmin (MWA1)](https://github.com/munki/munkiwebadmin/wiki)\r\n  * [munkireport-php](https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php)\r\n  * [munki-enroll](https://github.com/edingc/munki-enroll)\r\n  * [autopkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg)\r\n  * [autopkgr](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr)\r\n\r\n### Latest Releases\r\n  * [munki](https://github.com/munki/munki/releases)\r\n  * [munkiadmin](https://github.com/hjuutilainen/munkiadmin/releases/)\r\n  * [autopkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/releases/latest)\r\n  * [autopkgr](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr/releases/latest)\r\n\r\n### Demo Setups\r\n  * [munki](https://github.com/munki/munki/wiki/Demonstration-Setup)\r\n  * [munkireport-php](https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php/blob/master/docs/setup.md)\r\n",
